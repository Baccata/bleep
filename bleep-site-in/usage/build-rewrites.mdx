# Build rewrites

The build itself is completely declarative, and that is enough for very, very many cases. For the few cases where you need more powers we have Build Rewrites.

A build rewrite can be used in a script to boot a variant of the build which is transformed in some arbitrary manner.

```scala
trait BuildRewrite {
  val name: BuildRewriteName

  def newExplodedProjects(oldBuild: model.Build): Map[model.CrossProjectName, model.Project]

}
```

Basically it takes a fully parsed and expanded build, and lets you take the complete set of projects and rewrite them to whatever you want.

For instance this build rewrite adds a scala compiler flag to all projects:
```scala
object AddDummyFlag extends BuildRewrite {
      override val name = model.BuildRewriteName("add-dummy-flag")

      override protected def newExplodedProjects(oldBuild: model.Build): Map[model.CrossProjectName, model.Project] =
        oldBuild.explodedProjects.map { case (crossName, p) =>
          (crossName, p.copy(scala = p.scala.map(s => s.copy(options = s.options union model.Options.parse(List("-foo"), None)))))
        }
    }
```

## Using rewritten builds in a script

You can write a script which uses this rewrite like this:

```scala
object GenDocumentation extends BleepScript("GenDocumentation") {
  override val rewrites: List[BuildRewrite] = List(AddDummyFlag)
    def run(started: Started, commands: Commands, args: List[String]): Unit = ???
}
```

Bleep considers a build which is booted with rewrites completely separate from the normal build, you can see it in the `.bleep` directory.

```
.bleep/builds/normal # the build you're working with from the command line
.bleep/builds/bsp # the build you're working with from IDE. This has semanticdb and a subset of all projects
.bleep/builds/add-dummy-flag # a name derived by appending names of all applied build rewrites
```

So this is the foundation you can use to for instance add jmh flags and run benchmarking scripts. You can add Scala.js `mapSourceURI` with a reference to a given git SHA you have found. Or pretty much anything else.
You can of course also publish and/or package your app based on one of these builds.


## Persisting rewritten builds
You can also write these rewritten builds back to the build file.
As such you have for instance the infrastructure to write a script which
1) checks out all bleep repositories in your organisation
2) applies patches. Think for instance dependency updates
3) pushes all the changes back into pull requests
